# Gabeâ€™s Garden #
Welcome to Gabe's garden. Fed up with America's food choices in the cafeteria's across schools nationwide, 12-year-old Gabe has set out on a mission to change the way kids eat. Gabe's idea is to have a garden that is grown, cultivated, and maintained  by the students. The harvest will then be used for delicious and nutritious recipes in the our school's cafeterias created and hopefully cooked, by the students. The goal is to inspire as many schools as possible to begin their own garden's providing **real** nutrition to our children again and not being served the normalized frankenfood which is surely contributing to the childhood chronic illness epidemic across the United States.

### Design Choices ###


#### Fonts ####
Poppins was chosen the paragraphs and information throughout the site. This style was chosen as it seems that the two fonts will compliment each other nicely. They wont be too different yet both are bold and stand out. I want the font to grasp the user's attention from the moment they hit the landing page.
<a></a>

#### Colours ####

An array of colors were used throughout the site. In the spirit of simplicity though, the predominant colors on the site are white and black.

Since the images are what the users should focus on most, white and black seemed to be the best approach.

Laid sporatically  through the site however, you will find hints of greenish-blues such as: #009999.
This color went beautifully on the site. It nicely breaks up the black and white without being visually straining to eyes.

  The two major errors were associated with impost env and json which were ignored.

### UI

1. Navigation
    - The navigation works as it's supposed to across all screens. In full width, the navbar displays links across the top of the page.

    - All pages tested on Android and current iOS platforms and returns as expected.
    - Poor response on Galaxy Fold (See unresolved issues.)
    - 

2. Tablet
    - All pages display properly across tablet screens. 

3. Desktop
    - Tested with Safari & Chrome
    - All items load as expected
    - Navbar working and displaying correctly
    - No overflow issues experienced
    - All items in correct positioning. 

### Issues and resolutions
---
* Problem: The mobile-first side nav links are not dislplaying. The error is "toggle is not defined"
* Cause: The cause was that toggle was not defined.
* Resolution: This was solved by calling the toggle functionin JS.
---
---
* Problem: In the last hours of coding, Gitpod decided to make it even more eventful by not allowing Changes to the live-website 
  The CSS changes being made were not being displayed.

* Cause:  This was an IDE issue.

* Resolution: This issue was not entirely solved. Throughout the last hours, I have had to completely stop my workspace. Shut it entirely down and 
  and the restart by stopping  and resetting the workspace to render the changes made. 
---
---
* Problem: Profile returned 404 error event. "Undefined error: 'event' is undefined.

* Cause: In  the middle of correcting cards fto be styled, I improperly deleted an important value tag needed to render the page.

* Resolution: In order to solve this minor issue, I was returned the value tag to it's home and the profile page rendered properly again.
---
---
* Problem: Improperly detecting and existing user re-registering.

* Cause: Duplicate username being used. 

* Resolution: Detect duplicate username and redirect to the login page.
---
* Problem: The cards are not rendering properly on the screen for the profile page.
* Cause: Unresolved issue that must be addressed.
* Resolution: Uknown at this point.
### Unresolved Issues
---
* Poor breakdown response on Galaxy Fold.

* I was unable to get the flash messages functioning as I ran out of time. Lacking user interaction
  reflects poorly on the app and is quite an issue. This problem will need to be resolved in the future.
  
* Create event card, I cannot implement jinja templating as it is a custom event. I cannot remove the value either. The value of the image then stays on the card. I ran out of time and brainspace to fix this error as well.

* Cards will not render properly onto the profile page screen.

## **Deployment**

### Local Deployment

I have created The-Garden project using Github, from there I used [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) to write my code. 
Then I used commits to git followed by "git push" to my GitHub repository. 
I've deployed this project to Heroku and used "git push heroku master" to make sure my pushes to GitHub were also made to Heroku. 

This project can be ran locally by following the following steps: (
I used Gitpod for development, so the following steps will be specific to Gitpod. 
You will need to adjust them depending on your IDE. You can find more information about installing packages using pip and virtual environments [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)


To clone the project: 

1. From the application's repository, click the "code" button and download the zip of the repository.
    Alternatively, you can clone the repository using the following line in your terminal:
  
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/susanmarie87/The-Garden.git
    ```
1. Access the folder in your terminal window and install the application's [required modules](https://github.com/Susanmarie87/The-Garden/blob/master/requirements.txt) using the following command:

    ```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    1. Sign-in or sign-up to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and create a new cluster
    * Within the Sandbox, click the collections button and after click Create Database (Add My Own Data) gs-Garden
    * Set up the following collections: [Click here to see the exact Database Structure](#database-structure)
      

          *** Add in Mongo data structures here ***

1. In your IDE, create a file containing your environmental variables called env.py at the root level of the application. 
    It will need to contain the following lines and variables:
    ```
    import os

    os.environ["IP"] = "0.0.0.0"
    os.environ["PORT"] = "5000"
    os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
    os.environ["DEBUG"] = "True"
    os.environ["MONGO_URI"] = "YOUR_MONGODB_URI"
    os.environ["MONGO_DBNAME"]= "DATABASE_NAME" 
    ```

    Please note that you will need to update the **SECRET_KEY** with your own secret key, as well as the **MONGO_URI** and **MONGO_DBNAME** variables with those provided by MongoDB.
    Tip for your SECRET_KEY, you can use a [Password Generator](https://passwordsgenerator.net/) in order to have a secure secret key. 
    I personlly recommend a length of 24 characters and exclude Symbols.
    To find your MONGO_URI, go to your clusters and click on connect. Choose connect your application and copy the link provided. 
    Don't forget to update the necessary fields like password and database name. 

    If you plan on pushing this application to a public repository, ensure that env.py is added to your .gitignore file.

1. The application can now be run locally. In your terminal, type the following command 
    ```
    python3 app.py. 
    ```
    ### To deploy your project on Heroku, use the following steps: 

1. Login to your Heroku account and create a new app. Choose your region. 
1. Ensure the Procfile and requirements.txt files exist are present and up-to-date in your local repository.  
    Requirements:
    ```
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
    ```
    Procfile:
    ```
    echo web: python app.py > Procfile
    ```
1. The Procfile should contain the following line:
    ```
    web: python app.py
    ```

1. Scroll down to "deployment method"-section. Choose "Github" for automatic deployment.
1. From the inputs below, make sure your github user is selected, and then enter the name for your repo. Click "search". When it finds the repo, click the "connect" button.
1. Scroll back up and click "settings". Scroll down and click "Reveal config vars". Set up the same variables as in your env.py (IP, PORT, SECRET_KEY, MONGO_URI and MONGODB_NAME):
    !You shouldn't set the DEBUG variable in under config vars, only in your env.py to prevent DEBUG being active on live website. 

    ```
    IP = 0.0.0.0
    PORT = 5000
    SECRET_KEY = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
    MONGO_URI = YOUR_MONGODB_URI
    MONGO_DBNAME = DATABASE_NAME
    ```

1. Scroll back up and click "Deploy". Scroll down and click "Enable automatic deployment".
1. Just beneath, click "Deploy branch". Heroku will now start building the app. When the build is complete, click "view app" to open it.
1. In order to commit your changes to the branch, use git push to push your changes.
